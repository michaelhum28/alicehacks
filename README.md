**Karnaugh Map Solver for AliceHacks hackathon**

The inspiration for Karnaugh Map Solver project stemmed from the frustration of spending hours manually simplifying Karnaugh Maps for digital circuits. Recognizing the need for a more efficient solution, the idea to create an online tool that automates the process was born.

K-Map Solver was crafted using a combination of Vite, React (for the frontend), and Tailwind CSS (for styling). JavaScript played a crucial role in integrating these technologies seamlessly, creating a cohesive and responsive user experience.

Developing the K-Map algorithm presented a significant challenge, requiring precision and versatility to handle diverse input scenarios. Linking the frontend components seamlessly also posed difficulties, demanding careful attention to ensure a smooth user interface.

We're proud of balancing a user-friendly interface with a robust backend, delivering a Karnaugh Map Solver that's efficient, visually appealing, and accessible.

The project provided invaluable lessons in algorithmic development, frontend-backend integration, and the importance of user feedback in iterative refinement. Understanding the nuances of Karnaugh Maps and honing our skills in React and Tailwind CSS enriched our development experience.

Looking ahead, we aim to enhance the Karnaugh Map Solver by incorporating additional K-Map algorithms depending on the number of variables given, and nicer UI.
